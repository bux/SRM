SRM _(Swifty Repo Manager)_ is a simple User Interface for managing multiple repositories for Swifty. The idea behind SRM is to have a single directory containing all mods and have them symlinked (or junction'ed) to the output folder.

## Download

SRM is available for Windows only via [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/bux/SRM/releases/latest).

## Contributing

SRM is entirely open-source and all contributions are welcome. Check out the issue list and open pull requests! All submitted code to SRM is assumed to be licensed under GPLv3.

Ideas and discussions are welcome.

_Note: I'm planning to port SRM to WPF_
